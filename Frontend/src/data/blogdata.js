            para1: "So you've just moved to a new city or looking to do so soon. This is likely to be for studying there or you've just gotten your first job and are looking to move to that city. Not only is the city new to you, so are the people and places except a few references whose name and contact number you carry in your phone.",

            para2: "Of all the worries you carry on your shoulder in this move, the biggest by far is where will you stay. The friend or acquaintance is good to crash on for the D day of your arrival but no longer. The other options available to you are a hotel room in the long lease, a rented house, one of the new Book a house for a month a time systems or being a paying guest at a house.",

            para3: "You already know that a hotel is too costly and not prudent even if you had the money to afford it. You can also see some glaring issues with the newer systems in that staying there long term comes not with a binding contract but a website booking similar to if you were booking a night. All that leaves you with is renting a house or being a PG. Let's look at these two in more detail.",


            para4: "Renting a house sounds the most prudent option if you're there for long until you realize that the house is not the only thing on the charts then. Meeting the owners just once or twice has its own set of issues from trust in you for them and vice versa. Then there is the struggle of getting homeowners who are willing to give you, a student or new joinee in the work force, a house. Once you surpass these, there is the worry of finding the right staff to work for your house, coordinating time with them, coordinating with the guards and neighbours and talking all the time by trial and error to find out which rules apply to your house, locality and the neighborhood in general. Seems tiresome for just you?",

            para5: "Let's see the last option on the list. Becoming a paying guest in a well settled and functional house. You may wonder why we call it that. The term itself suggests that you are a guest to the household you wish to call your own, so how can it be better you ask. You may be a guest to our homeowners when you walk in but we all know of times when guests become friends and family. That is the purpose here.",

            para6: "You will not have to worry about multiple people to contact and coordinate daily life with. Our homeowners are there for you as we know you will be there for them. It is not too hard for us to imagine a long day after college, when you step back home, you do not have to open the lock to an empty house. The homeowners look to making you a part of their lives not just their homes. With our verification processes in place, they know you can be trusted and you know they can be. It does not take a long stretch of imagination to see you bonding with them over weekdays and weekends as also with the neighbours. Do you know the best part, this is also the most pocket friendly option for you.",

            para7: "The intangible benefits we have discussed so let us talk of the benefits to you that you can measure. You save because you don't necessarily pay for the whole house, just your room or bed. You save because you don't have to worry about locality charges over and above what is listed by our homeowners. You save because you don't have to struggle to make four walls a house, it is already in place. And most importantly, you save because you don't have to run pillar to post doing the paperwork for renting, we take care of the paperwork.",

            para8: "All said and done, as a newcomer to the city, you do wish to save money also so let us allow you the chance."

            para1: "Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the world’s economy was shut down almost overnight . The pandemic has confronted the hospitality industry with an unprecedented challenge. Strategies to flatten the COVID-19 curve such as community lockdowns, social distancing, stay-at-home orders, travel and mobility restrictions have resulted in temporary closure of many hospitality businesses and significantly decreased the demand for businesses that were allowed to continue to operate. Restrictions placed on travel and stay-at-home orders issued by the authorities led to sharp decline in hotel occupancies and revenues. However, the reopening process has slowly begun and authorities have started to ease restrictions.",

            para2: "While the hospitality industry is slowly recovering, the COVID-19 crisis continues to exert profound impacts on how hospitality businesses operate. Hospitality businesses are expected to make substantial changes to their operations in the COVID-19 business environment in order to ensure employee's and customer's health and safety, and enhance customer's willingness to patronize their business .",
